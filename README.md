# Rock Paper Scissors Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game in JavaScript. The game is initially played entirely in the console, with plans to incorporate a graphical user interface (GUI) in the future.

## Project Overview
The project aims to create a Rock Paper Scissors game that follows these steps:

1. Set up the project structure with an HTML file and a linked JavaScript file.
2. Write the logic to randomly generate the computer's choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
3. Write the logic to get the human player's choice from user input.
4. Declare variables to keep track of the players' scores.
5. Write the logic to play a single round, determine the winner, and update the scores.
6. Write the logic to play the entire game, consisting of 5 rounds, and declare the overall winner.

### How to Play
To play the game in the console, follow these steps:

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Open the browser's developer console (usually by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting "Inspect").
3. The game will prompt you to enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
4. Enter your choice in the console and press Enter.
5. The game will display the results of the round and the updated scores.
6. The game will continue for 5 rounds, and the overall winner will be declared at the end.

### Future Improvements
In the future, a graphical user interface (GUI) will be implemented to enhance the user experience and make the game more interactive. The GUI will likely include:

* Buttons or clickable elements for the player to select their choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
* Visual representation of the computer's choice and the round results.
* Display of the current scores and the overall winner.

The README file will be updated with instructions on how to interact with the GUI once it is implemented.
