# Rock Paper Scissors Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game in JavaScript. The game is initially played entirely in the console, with plans to incorporate a graphical user interface (GUI) in the future.

## Project Overview
The project aims to create a Rock Paper Scissors game that follows these steps:

1. Set up the project structure with an HTML file and a linked JavaScript file.
2. Write the logic to randomly generate the computer's choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
3. Write the logic to get the human player's choice from user input.
4. Declare variables to keep track of the players' scores.
5. Write the logic to play a single round, determine the winner, and update the scores.
6. Write the logic to play the entire game, consisting of 5 rounds, and declare the overall winner.

### How to Play

### Future Improvements
In the future, a graphical user interface (GUI) will be implemented to enhance the user experience and make the game more interactive. The GUI will likely include:

* Buttons or clickable elements for the player to select their choice firewall, virus, backdoor(rock, paper, or scissors).
* Visual representation of the computer's choice and the round results.
* Display of the current scores and the overall winner.
